# Purescript GraphQL

PureScript GraphQL is a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) implementation written in PureScript. It features a powerful DSL that will make building GraphQL servers as typesafe as possible.

> ### ðŸš§ Full rewrite happening ðŸš§
>
> This is a complete rewrite of PureScript GraphQL. If you are looking for version 1 of PureScript GraphQL make sure to check out the [1.0.1 tag](https://github.com/hendrikniemann/purescript-graphql/tree/v1.0.1).
>
> Version 2 of PureScript GraphQL will be written in PureScript and no longer depend on the JavaScript implementation under the hood. This is to support user defined execution through deriving from the classic resolver model where child resolvers are only called after the parent value has arrived.

## Future API

This is a sneak peak of the future PureScript GraphQL API. If you want to give feedback please open an issue.

```purescript
module Main where

import Prelude

import Data.Argonaut.Core (stringify)
import Effect (Effect)
import Effect.Console as Console
import GraphQL (graphql)
import GraphQL.Type as GraphQL
import GraphQL.Type.Scalar as Scalar

main :: Effect Unit
main = Console.log $ stringify $
  graphql schema "{ hello }" unit unit Nothing Nothing
-- {"data":{"hello":"world"}}

schema :: GraphQL.Schema Unit
schema = GraphQL.Schema { query: queryType, mutation: Nothing }

queryType :: GraphQL.ObjectType String
queryType =
  GraphQL.objectType "Query"
    .> "The root query type."
    :> GraphQL.field "hello" Scalar.string
      .> "A simple field that always returns \"world\"."
      !> const "world"
```
