# Purescript GraphQL

PureScript GraphQL is a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) implementation written in PureScript. It features a powerful DSL that will make building GraphQL servers as typesafe as possible.

> ### ğŸš§ Full rewrite happening ğŸš§
>
> This is a complete rewrite of PureScript GraphQL. If you are looking for version 1 of PureScript GraphQL make sure to check out the [1.0.1 tag](https://github.com/hendrikniemann/purescript-graphql/tree/v1.0.1).
>
> Version 2 of PureScript GraphQL will be written in PureScript and no longer depend on the JavaScript implementation under the hood. This is to support user defined execution through deriving from the classic resolver model where child resolvers are only called after the parent value has arrived.

## Future API

This is a sneak peak of the future PureScript GraphQL API. If you want to give feedback please open an issue.

```purescript
module Main where

import Prelude

import Data.Argonaut.Core (stringify)
import Data.Either (Either(..))
import Effect (Effect)
import Effect.Console as Console
import Effect.Exception (Error)
import GraphQL (graphql)
import GraphQL.Type ((!>), (.>), (:>))
import GraphQL.Type as GraphQL
import GraphQL.Type.Scalar as Scalar

main :: Effect Unit
main = case graphql schema "{ hello }" (pure unit) of
  Left error -> Console.error $ show error
  Right result -> Console.log $ stringify result
-- {"data":{"hello":"world"}}

schema :: GraphQL.Schema (Either Error) Unit
schema = GraphQL.Schema { query: queryType }

queryType :: GraphQL.ObjectType (Either Error) Unit
queryType =
  GraphQL.objectType "Query"
    .> "The root query type."
    :> GraphQL.field "hello" Scalar.string
      .> "A simple field that always returns \"world\"."
      !> (\_ _ -> pure "world")
```
